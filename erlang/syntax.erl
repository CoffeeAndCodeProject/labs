%% PUNCTUATION                  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% There 3 types of punctuation in Erlang:
%
% - Commas (`,`) separate arguments in function calls, data constructors, and
% patterns.
%
% - Periods (`.`) (followed by whitespace) separate entire functions and
% expressions in the shell.
%
% - Semicolons (`;`) separate clauses. We find clauses in several contexts:
% function definitions and in `case`, `if`, `try..catch` and `receive`
% expressions.
