% Modules are the basic unit of code in Erlang.
% All the functions we write are stored in modules.
% Modules are stored in files with .erl extensions.
% Modules must be compiled before the code can be run.
% A compiled module has the extension .beam

% - Beam is short for Bogdanâ€™s Erlang Abstract Machine;
% Bogumil (Bogdan) Hausman wrote an Erlang compiler in 1993
% and designed a new instruction set for Erlang.
